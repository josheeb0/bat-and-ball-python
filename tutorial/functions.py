# Spot any coding patterns in this program?

#pattern is you define stuff and everything is colour coded like "" and print and input is purple?
# I make a function called i_am_a_function and I use the same text elsewhere in the program to run it.
#you define i am a function to print hello world at the start and whenever you say i_am_a_function it refers to that define at the start
# well done
# when you store something in a variable, it gets stored in memory and you can pull it out of memory and use it quickly later
# large files have to be loaded in chunks so we dont use too much memory
# like minecraft chunks where something can be loaded one chunk at a time, yeah it probably streams the data rather than putting whole map in memory
# you said i am a function 3 times and it refered to it 3 times so cool with hello world print
# yeah thats correct
#you define enter garbage as print garbage entered
# then whatever you type is printed back - the input statement is the bit that actually prompts the user
