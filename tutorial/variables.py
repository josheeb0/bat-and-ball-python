# you define variable 1 2 3 4 5 and then make it print what it = to
# = means assign
# yeah i know a little bit from my LUA
# roblox has given me a head start
# ah nice
# do you know what a data type is?
# no but i know data stores
# data is stored in memory in different lengths
# because a Boolean can only be True or False, so it needs only one bit
# a string can be unicode emojis or any number of characters so it needs 8 bits hence UTF-8
# to handle this in coding languages, you need data types
# emojis are basicially just like U#23132 or something but your OS or software changes the U# to an image
# yeah very good
# i want to master python
# do you see the different data types being printed out?
# can you match then to the data on the first line, do yuo see a pattern?
# look at output
# idk lets call
